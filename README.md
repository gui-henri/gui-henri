<h1>Hi &#129311, you can call me Gui!</h1>

 - I'm graduating at Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco(UFRPE) and currently work on Seed a Bit Technology.
 
 - Restless, i'm always willing to learn new technologies and colaborate in the most diverse projects. In my short experience, i already worked with Frontend development using React and NextJS, Mobile development with Flutter and Machine Learning.
 
 - Some of the projects that i'm proud of are:
   - <a href="https://github.com/gui-henri/PISI3"><h3>MoviePicker: </h3></a> Here i developed a full movie recommendation mobile app using Flutter and Machine Learning with Python. It was a big project, sustained by the collaboration of many developers. But even so, i had the opportunity to lead the team as an informal leader.  
   - <a href="seedabit.org.br"><h3>Seed a Bit Website: </h3></a> My first commercial project at Seed a Bit, my team was responsible for developing the company website in it's totality. Here i used HTML, CSS and Javascript to build advanced features, such as forms and objects with very specific styling. Most of the basic features and the blog were built using Wordpress.
   - <h3>Freelancing: </h3> I worked as a freelancer in the development of a mobile app, again using Flutter. The aim of the project was to help language teachers identify the terms that students had the most difficulty learning, and thanks to the app, their work was easen.

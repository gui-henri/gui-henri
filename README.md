Hi, you can call me Gui!

 - I'm graduating at Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco(UFRPE). I'm finding my way into the development world, experiencing a lot of technologies and languages to find where i fit the best.
 
 - I started in programming a two years ago with Game Development using the Godot Game Engine. It uses a python-like scripting language, that allowed me to learn the various fundamentals in the programming universe.

 - A year later, i learned the web fundamentals and started with JavaScript and Node.JS, getting experience with React, Express and Svelte.

 - While i studied backend with Node.JS, i also got in touch with Java and Spring Boot. I fell in love with the framework, and now i'm focusing on him as my backend framework of choice.

 - At start of the year of 2022, i got into college.
 
 - Today, i'm learning the basics of Android development and i plan on learning Flutter in the future. 
 
 - I believe that having touch with as many areas as possible while learning the strong fundamentals of maths, data structures and data analysis on college will make me have a good understanding of the whole business, thus a more competent developer.
